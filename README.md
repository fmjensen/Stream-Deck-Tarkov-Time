# Stream Deck Tarkov Time
This plugin shows the current ingame Escape from Tarkov time on a button of your choise. Stream Deck Tarkov Time is calculated from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The shown Tarkov Time is updated every 7 seconds and on button press. 

Note that Stream Deck Tarkov Time does _not_ need the Escape from Tarkov game to be running to be able to show the two timezones on the button you choose.
